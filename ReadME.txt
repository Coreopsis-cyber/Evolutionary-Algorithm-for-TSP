This Project uses a Jupyter Notebook to experiment with the parameters of an Evolutionary Algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem. 

Requirements:
 
To run this Travelling Salesman Evolutionary Algorithm notebook, you must have Python installed and some IDE that runs an .ipynb file, such as vs studio code or Anaconda Navigator (for jupyter notebook).
Within this folder are the two XML files required to run the functions, which must be in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook file for the file to work.

All other files are convergence curves generated by experiments run. They are titled with the parameters used.
